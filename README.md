# Vigilix

Vigilix is an advanced network intrusion detection system (NIDS) designed to identify and classify various types of network attacks, including DDoS, DoS, and more, using machine learning models. The system is built to process large-scale network traffic data, with a primary focus on the CIC-IDS 2017 dataset.

The project leverages powerful and scalable machine learning algorithms to achieve high-accuracy detection and provide insights into the nature of network threats.

### üìù Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip

#### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AtharSayed/Vigilix.git](https://github.com/AtharSayed/Vigilix.git)
    cd Vigilix
    ```

2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).

#### Usage

1.  **Place your dataset**: Ensure your `cic-collection.parquet` file is placed in the `data/raw/` directory.

2.  **Train a model**:
    * To train the **XGBoost** model:
        ```bash
        python model/train-xgb.py
        ```
    * To train the **Isolation Forest** model:
        ```bash
        python model/train-iso.py
        ```

3.  **View results**:
    * Trained models will be saved in the `model_output/` directory.
    * Evaluation reports and plots will be saved in the `results/` directory.
